# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description: Simple Counter Application
The Counter Application is a basic React project designed to increment and decrement a numerical value based on user input. The primary goal of this application is to provide a minimal, interactive user interface where the user can increase or decrease the counter value by clicking buttons.

Features:
Increment and Decrement Buttons:

The application will feature two buttons: Increment (+) and Decrement (-), allowing users to adjust the counter value.
Clicking the Increment button will increase the displayed value by 1.
Clicking the Decrement button will decrease the value by 1.
Real-time Counter Display:

The counter value will be displayed dynamically on the screen, updating immediately as the user interacts with the buttons.
The value will be stored in React’s state, ensuring a responsive UI.
User Input Handling:

Users can interact with the buttons to either increase or decrease the counter.
The application will ensure the counter’s value is updated in real-time with each click.
Boundary Handling:

The application can have boundary conditions to prevent the counter from going below a specific value, such as 0, or it can allow negative values depending on the use case.
If boundaries are enforced, users will see a message or visual indication when trying to decrease the counter beyond the allowed limit.
Interactive UI:

The Increment and Decrement buttons will be styled interactively, with hover and active effects to enhance user experience.
The counter display will be styled to make it visually prominent.
State Management:

React’s useState hook will be used to manage the current value of the counter.
Each time the user clicks a button, the state will update, and the UI will re-render to reflect the new counter value.
Attractive CSS:

The application will feature clean and responsive design with simple yet engaging CSS for the buttons and counter display.
Hover effects and transitions will be added to make the buttons more interactive.
This simple counter application provides a user-friendly way to increment or decrement a value, with real-time updates and intuitive controls. It is an ideal starter project for practicing state management in React.
