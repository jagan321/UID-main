# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description: CRUD Application with Database Integration
The CRUD Application is a web-based project built to manage user data through basic operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The application will allow users to interact with a backend database, enabling seamless data manipulation. This project is ideal for managing any form of structured data (such as student information, employee records, etc.) and follows the RESTful architecture for communication between the frontend and backend.

Features:
Create (Add Data):

Users can input new records using a form. For example, fields might include details like name, email, phone number, and age.
After the form submission, the application will send a POST request to the backend API, which will store the new data in the database.
A validation system will be in place to ensure that required fields are filled out correctly.
Read (View Data):

The application will retrieve and display data from the database in a tabular format. Each record (row) will contain options to edit or delete the data.
A GET request will be sent to the API to fetch all records, which will be rendered on the frontend.
The display will be dynamic, updating automatically when data is added, edited, or deleted.
Update (Edit Data):

Users can edit existing records by clicking an "Edit" button next to each record.
When clicked, the data will populate a form, allowing the user to modify the existing values.
After editing, a PUT request will be sent to update the record in the database.
Once updated, the changes will reflect in real-time on the user interface.
Delete (Remove Data):

Users will have the option to delete individual records by clicking the "Delete" button next to each entry.
A DELETE request will be sent to the backend API, and the record will be removed from the database.
The data table will update immediately, removing the deleted record from the display.
Backend and Database Integration:

The application will use a backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express) to handle API requests and interact with the database.
The database (e.g., MongoDB) will store all records persistently, ensuring that data is available even after refreshing or closing the browser.
Validation and Error Handling:

Both frontend and backend validations will ensure that data entered by the user is accurate (e.g., correct format for email, phone number).
Error messages will be displayed in case of invalid input or failed database operations.
Responsive and User-Friendly UI:

The application will have a simple, responsive interface with clean CSS styling, ensuring that users on both desktop and mobile devices can manage data effortlessly.
Each feature (Add, View, Edit, Delete) will be intuitive, with well-labeled buttons and clear instructions for user interactions.
Real-time Data Updates:

Data displayed on the application will update in real-time as changes are made, without requiring a page refresh. This will be achieved using React's state management and asynchronous API calls.
This CRUD application provides a seamless way for users to manage data efficiently. It offers flexibility in handling different types of records and ensures robust performance through real-time database communication.
