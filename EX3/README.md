# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description: Calculator Application Using React's State
The Calculator Application is a simple React-based project designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This application leverages React’s state management to handle user input, display results, and manage operations dynamically.

Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

The calculator will support essential arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Users will be able to input numbers and choose an operation to get a result.
State Management:

The calculator's display, inputs, and results will be managed using React’s useState hook.
The useState hook will track the current input, the previous number (if any), and the selected operation (if any).
After each calculation, the state will update to reflect the new result or reset when the user wants to perform a new operation.
User Input Handling:

The application will have a clean UI that includes number buttons (0-9), operation buttons (+, -, *, /), and a display area.
When users click a button, the corresponding number or operation will be added to the state and displayed on the screen.
Clear Functionality:

A Clear (C) button will allow users to reset the state, clearing the display and starting a new calculation.
Real-time Result Display:

As users perform calculations, the result will be dynamically updated on the screen without requiring any page reloads.
After pressing the equal button (=), the application will calculate the result based on the current state and display it.
Interactive and Responsive Design:

The calculator will have an interactive UI with button hover effects and smooth transitions to enhance user experience.
It will also be responsive, working across desktop and mobile devices.
Error Handling:
The app will include basic error handling, such as preventing division by zero and handling any invalid inputs to ensure smooth functionality.
By using React’s state management for user input, calculations, and results display, this calculator provides an interactive, real-time arithmetic experience. The modular design ensures maintainability and scalability for future enhancements.
