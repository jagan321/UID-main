# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment
Project Description: React-based Client Website

The project involves creating a React-based website for a client, focusing on a clean and user-friendly design. The website will be built using reusable components, modern elements, and attractive styling.

Key Features:
Reusable Components: The website will be structured using React components like Header, Footer, HomePage, About, Services, and ContactForm, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

Navigation: A dynamic Navbar component will allow seamless navigation between different sections of the website, such as Home, About, Services, and Contact.

Interactive Forms: The site will include a ContactForm component, allowing clients to get in touch directly. The form will have interactive validation and user-friendly error messages.

Responsive Design: The website will be fully responsive across devices, ensuring an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Styled Components: The project will make use of styled components for CSS-in-JS, allowing for customization and consistent styling. Colors, fonts, and layout will be chosen based on the client’s brand guidelines.

Custom Animations: Interactive elements like buttons and images will have smooth hover effects, transitions, and animations for a more engaging user experience.

API Integration: If required, the project will integrate third-party APIs to provide features like fetching real-time data or interacting with external services.

Dark Mode: A toggle switch for light and dark mode will be provided, giving users control over their preferred theme.

By leveraging React’s component-driven architecture and modern web development practices, the website will be scalable, maintainable, and visually appealing, meeting the client's needs effectively.
