# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description: User Profile Component
The User Profile component in React will display a user's personal information dynamically using props. This will allow the parent component to pass down user data (like name, profile picture, bio, etc.) to the UserProfile component, making it reusable for different users.

Features:
User Information Display:

The component will display the user's profile picture, name, job title, and a short bio.
These values will be passed as props to make the component flexible for various users.
Props for Data Handling:

The UserProfile component will accept props such as:
name: The user's full name.
jobTitle: The userâ€™s profession.
bio: A brief bio of the user.
profilePicture: URL for the user's profile picture.
Styling:

The component will have clean and minimalistic CSS styling.
The profile picture will be styled to appear circular, and the entire profile card will have a shadow effect for an enhanced look.
Reusable Component:

Since the data is passed via props, the UserProfile component can be reused to display the profile of any user with different data, keeping the component DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
